## Directions
@date=2019-11-20
@tags=blog,github,coding

Blog articles are added in reverse chronological order (so put new content on the top of this file).

* Start each article with ## Article title
* Each article will get its own page linked off the homepage
* Use @date and @tags to set those attributes. @tags will make a tag page for each tag /tags/tagName, and the articles with that tag will appear on that page.
* @date is used in the rss feed and below the article title
* Remove all the content below and rebuild to get rid of the articles.
* Put images in the image directory and link to them like so:
  * ![Submarine Playhouse](images/2019-04-24&#32;submarine&#32;playhouse.jpg)


## A very very simple blog
@date=2019-11-20
@tags=blog
This blog was created with a simple markdown file and a directory of images. Trying to come up with a good way to host it will be interesting

I should come up with a new username on twitter and domain name to match it.

## Burning the midnight oil
@date=2019-11-20
@tags=habits

3am is often the time I wake up, eat some cereal and do about an hour or so of hacking before heading back to bed at 5am. It just seems to be the most productive time for me (assuming I don't get wrapped up in social media).

## Godot asset store
@date=2019-11-19
@tags=godot,godotassetstore

I started developing the [Godot Asset Store](https://godotasset.store) a few weeks ago. It is built with Angular and node.js as the backend api with nginx as the frontend.

I am getting to the tricky parts now:

* Auth
* Fetching content from github
* payments
* splitting out payments
* accounting details

## Stack overflow
@date=2019-11-01
@tags=stackoverflow

Stack Overflow is like a magic wish granting genie, if all your wishes are constrained to be answers to technical problems. Pretty much and far flung technical question I put in there, the right person comes along and provides an answer.
